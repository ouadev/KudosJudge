bootstrapping steps:
+ create ramfs directory
+ init compilers list
+ load all shared libraries that the compilers need
+ load compilers into ramfs
+ choose use mode
	(contest: create a dir with testcases(in&out) ,
	standalone:accept code,infile,and outfile from network)


daemon:
+ receive submission
+ compile
+ run & compare results
+ returns the judgement.


requirements:
+ limit resources during running
+ manage well the ramfs memory (balance between HD and RAM for weak computers), to avoid killing the system.
+ security during the run, espicially the daemon has cap_root
+ speed
