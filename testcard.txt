.Notes

+ fix the verdicts, so if any error occured in the SERVER, the client should always INTERNAL_ERROR, anf RUNTIME_ERROR if the problem is in their code.
+ even if the Judge works well, add some time limits to pipes and reading to gain more stability. 
+ deactivate a worker if something went wrong, so it doesn't take work next time
