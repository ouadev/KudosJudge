.Notes

+ BUG :	WRONG_ANSWER submissions blocks sometimes and make the worker unusable. 
+ even if the Judge works well, add some time limits to pipes and reading to gain more stability. 
+ deactivate a worker if something went wrong, so it doesn't take work next time.
+ reject requests with TRY_LATER response when the Queue is full.






. Benchmarking

+ wost-case scenario : the submission takes 5s of cpu time, and receive 1M of data stream
	+ design a standard program
+ calculate Mean Service Time : the time it takes to judge a correct (full cpu time) request.
+ Mean Service Time of a wrong/compile/runtime errors is MST miltiplied by the proportion of time the error occured.
+ example of contest where standard ACM => 100 clients. sending requests every 1minute.
	+ == 100requests/minutes ~= 2 requests/second
