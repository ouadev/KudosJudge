I always seem to need a good ini parser for various projects and
usually hack one together each time. To remedy this I built this
simple one that will process a standard INI file of the following
form:

----------------------- BEGIN SNIP -----------------------------------

[section1]

key1 = hello
key2= 2.56
key3:12

;; this is a comment
test1 : somethine else here

; this is also a comment
# and yet another comment
[section 2]

key1 = something in section 2
test1: true

----------------------- END SNIP -------------------------------------

The reader is very simple to use, see main.c for how.
